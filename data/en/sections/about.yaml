# a summary about you
summary: 'I am a Materials Science PhD candidate (with concurrent MS in Electrical and Computer Eng.) at Duke University. On research, I love to explore
modeling and experimental optics, electrochemistry, personal heat management and their applications on wearable devices. In addition, I am deeply captivated by the impact of science and technology on the market and industry.


My experiences and skills have grown from both academic research and industrial collaboration. I led projects and assisted on writing proposal with Sony and Cambrios during my PhD. My goal is to provide research-based advices and analyses from both scientific and business point of view.
